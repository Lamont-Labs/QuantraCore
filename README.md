# QuantraCore™ — AI Trading Intelligence Engine

**Owner:** Jesse J. Lamont  
**Org:** Lamont-Labs  
**Version:** v3.7u  
**Date:** 2025-10-07  
**Status:** Demo-ready, deterministic handoff seed  
**Repo:** https://github.com/Lamont-Labs/QuantraCore

---

## 📖 Purpose
QuantraCore™ is an institutional-grade deterministic AI trading demo.  
It proves that AI signal engines can be **transparent, reproducible, and compliance-safe** without relying on hype.  
Every output is **replayable, hashed, and logged**, so any reviewer can confirm provenance and determinism.  
This is a **truth-only demo** — no live trading, no user data, and no external brokerage.
