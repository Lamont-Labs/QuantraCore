## What Makes It Different

1. **Forward Validation** — Predictions recorded before outcomes are known. No backtest fiction.

2. **Institutional Audit Trails** — Every trade logged with entry rationale, stop-loss rules, and exit conditions.

3. **Autonomous Risk Management** — Hard stops (-15%), trailing stops (+10% activation, 8% trail), time-based exits.

4. **End-of-Day Only** — Uses closing prices for reliable signals. No intraday noise.

## Technology Stack

- Python/FastAPI backend with 263 API endpoints
- Machine learning ensemble models (GradientBoosting)
- PostgreSQL for model persistence
- React/TypeScript dashboard
- 104,000+ lines of code

---

## What We're Looking For

- **Strategic acquisition** by a fund, prop trading firm, or fintech company
- **Partnership** to validate signals at institutional scale
- **Not raising capital** to build a company

---

## Honest Assessment

This is a working prototype with live paper validation in progress. The track record is early — measured in days, not years. What's proven is the infrastructure, methodology, and autonomous operation. What's unproven is long-term edge.

---

## Next Steps

We're building the track record publicly. Interested parties can:
- Review live portfolio data
- Access full audit trails
- Monitor forward validation results
