## Key Talking Points

### On the System
- "It runs autonomously — detects signals, sizes positions, manages stops, logs everything."
- "We use end-of-day data only. No intraday noise, no high-frequency competition."
- "Everything is logged before outcomes are known. No backtest fiction."

### On the Track Record
- "We have about a week of live paper trading. That's a demo, not proof."
- "What IS proven is the infrastructure works. Signals fire. Orders execute. Stops trigger."
- "Building the track record publicly is the point — transparency over hype."

### On What You Want
- "I'm not raising capital to grow a company. I built this to be acquired."
- "The right buyer is a fund, prop desk, or fintech that wants this capability."
- "Or a partner who wants to validate signals at their scale."

### On Honesty
- "I won't claim proven edge with a week of data. That would be dishonest."
- "What I can show is working infrastructure and a methodology for proving edge."
- "If it works over 6-12 months, the data will show it. If it doesn't, same."

## Anticipated Questions

### "What's your track record?"
> "About a week of paper trading. 10 positions, 70% win rate, +4% return. Too early to claim anything statistically — but the infrastructure is proven."

### "Why should I believe this works?"
> "You shouldn't yet. That's why we have forward validation. Every prediction is logged before the outcome. In 6-12 months, you can see exactly what it predicted and what happened."

### "What are you asking for?"
> "Not investment. I'm looking for acquisition or partnership. Someone who wants this technology in their operation."

### "What's the valuation?"
> "I don't have a number. I'd want to understand what value this creates for the buyer and work backward from there."

### "Why would you sell this instead of trading it yourself?"
> "I'm a builder, not a fund manager. I like creating systems. Running money is a different business."

### "What if I want to see the code?"
> "Happy to do a technical walkthrough. Full code access with an NDA."

### "What's your background?"
> "Self-taught developer. Built this from scratch over [time period]. No formal finance background — which means I approached it differently than quants from that world."

### "What do you need to keep going?"
> "Time and validation. The system is running. If someone wants to accelerate testing with real capital or infrastructure, that's a conversation."

- Don't invent numbers or projections
- Don't promise specific future performance
- Don't badmouth other systems or competitors
- Don't pretend you're further along than you are
