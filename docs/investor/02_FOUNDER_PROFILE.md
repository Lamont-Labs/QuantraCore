## Who Is Jesse?

Jesse Lamont is a systems architect and product visionary with an unconventional path into quantitative trading infrastructure. His background spans hands-on craftsmanship (cabinet-making), technical systems design, and AI-assisted development.

## The Journey

### From Craftsman to Systems Architect

Jesse's career began in precision woodworking, where he developed an obsession with repeatable processes, quality control, and systematic approaches to complex problems. This foundation in deterministic craftsmanship directly informs QuantraCore's architecture: every output must be reproducible, every process auditable.

### AI-Augmented Development

QuantraCore Apex was built using a modern AI-assisted development workflow. Jesse leveraged large language models as coding partners while maintaining architectural vision and quality control. This approach allowed rapid iteration on a complex system that would traditionally require a full engineering team.

**What AI tools contributed:**
- Code generation for boilerplate and protocol implementations
- Test suite scaffolding and edge case identification
- Documentation generation and specification refinement

**What Jesse personally contributed:**
- Overall system architecture and design philosophy
- Protocol logic and trading domain expertise
- Quality control, integration, and coherence across modules
- Vision for the deterministic-to-neural pipeline

## Proof of Persistence

| Evidence | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Master Specification** | 180-page technical specification covering all system components |
| **Protocol Inventory** | 145 protocols designed, documented, and implemented |
| **Test Suite** | 970 automated tests with determinism verification |
| **Iteration History** | Months of development from v7.x through v9.0-A |
| **Documentation** | Comprehensive investor, technical, and operational documentation |

This is not a weekend project or a concept deck — it's a working system with production-quality code.

## Realistic Gaps

Jesse is transparent about limitations:

| Gap | Reality | Mitigation |
|-----|---------|------------|
| **Non-technical founder** | Cannot scale solo coding indefinitely | Seeking senior engineering partners |
| **Infrastructure experience** | Limited production deployment experience | Needs infra/ops expertise |
| **Capital constraints** | Bootstrapped to date | Seeking investment for team and data |
| **Regulatory expertise** | Research-only mode; live trading needs counsel | Would require compliance partnership |

---

## What Jesse Wants

> "I want to architect and steer, not be the solo coder forever."

The ideal outcome is a partnership where Jesse:

1. **Maintains architectural vision** — Continues to define system direction and protocol evolution
2. **Guides product development** — Ensures the deterministic philosophy is preserved
3. **Collaborates with senior engineers** — Learns from and works alongside experienced practitioners
4. **Focuses on innovation** — Develops next-generation features (ApexVision, continuous learning)

---

## Working Style

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Detail-oriented** | Specifications are exhaustive and internally consistent |
| **Honest about limits** | Risks and limitations are stated upfront |
| **Iterative** | Builds, tests, refines — not "ship and forget" |
| **AI-native** | Comfortable using AI tools as productivity multipliers |
| **Vision-driven** | Clear long-term direction for the platform |

---

## Why Trust This Person?

1. **The work exists.** This isn't a pitch deck — it's a working system with 1145 tests and 145 protocols.

2. **Honest positioning.** Risks and gaps are stated upfront, not hidden in footnotes.

3. **Domain understanding.** The architecture reflects genuine understanding of quantitative trading requirements (determinism, auditability, fail-closed behavior).

4. **Persistence.** Months of development, multiple major versions, comprehensive documentation.

5. **Self-awareness.** Knows what he's good at (architecture, vision) and what he needs (engineering partners, capital).
