## Development Principles

All roadmap items must adhere to:

| Principle | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Determinism | No randomness in any component |
| Fail-Closed | Safe defaults on any failure |
| Privacy | Local-only data processing |
| Compliance | No trade recommendations |
| Reproducibility | Hash-locked, versioned |
| Modularity | File-isolated components |

---

## Version History

| Version | Release | Highlights |
|---------|---------|------------|
| 8.0 | Current | Full v8.0 specification |
| 7.x | Previous | Foundation protocols |
| 6.x | Legacy | Initial ApexCore |

---

## Contributing

Development contributions follow strict guidelines:

1. All changes must maintain determinism
2. All changes must pass golden set tests
3. All changes must be documented
4. All changes require review
