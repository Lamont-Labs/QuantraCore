## Company Overview

**QuantraCore Apex** is an institutional-grade deterministic AI trading intelligence engine designed for desktop deployment. The system provides structural market analysis through proprietary protocols, neural assistant models, and comprehensive risk management.

---

## The Problem

Quantitative trading systems face critical challenges:
- **Non-reproducibility:** Most AI systems produce inconsistent outputs
- **Regulatory risk:** Insufficient compliance margins
- **Cloud dependency:** Data sovereignty concerns
- **Safety gaps:** Inadequate fail-safe mechanisms
- **Opacity:** Black-box predictions without auditability

---

## The Solution

QuantraCore Apex delivers:

| Capability | Value |
|------------|-------|
| **100% Determinism** | Identical inputs always produce identical outputs |
| **Fail-Closed Design** | System defaults to safe state on any error |
| **Offline Operation** | Zero cloud dependencies, complete data sovereignty |
| **Regulatory Excellence** | 3-5x stricter than SEC/FINRA/MiFID II/Basel |
| **Full Auditability** | Cryptographic proof chain for every analysis |

---

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Test Suite** | 970 tests, 100% pass rate |
| **Compliance Score** | 99.25% (EXCEPTIONAL) |
| **Protocol Inventory** | 115 proprietary protocols |
| **API Endpoints** | 36 REST endpoints |
| **Core Modules** | 12 validated modules |
| **Regulatory Margin** | 3-5x above requirements |
